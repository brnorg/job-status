# Job Status Action

## Description

The **Job Status Action** is a GitHub Action that allows you to monitor the status of a specific job in a GitHub Actions workflow. It checks the job's status at defined intervals and waits for a specified period after the job completes before finishing. If the monitored job fails or is canceled, the action will be interrupted and marked as failed.

## How It Works

1. **Monitors the status**: Checks the status of the specified job at defined intervals.
2. **Waits after completion**: After the monitored job completes, it waits for a defined period before ending.
3. **Interrupts on failure**: If the monitored job fails or is canceled, the action is stopped and marked as failed.

## Inputs

- `job_name` (required): The name of the job to monitor.
- `wait_time` (required): The time to wait after the job completes, in seconds.
- `poll_interval` (optional): The interval to check the job status, in seconds. Default is 30 seconds.

## Example Usage

Hereâ€™s an example of how to use the **Job Status Action** in a GitHub Actions workflow:

```yaml
name: Example Workflow with Job Status

on: [push]

jobs:
  job1:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Run some tasks
        run: |
          echo "This is job1 running."
          sleep 20

  job2:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: job1
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Execute tasks in job2
        run: |
          echo "This is job2 running."
          sleep 10
          # Uncomment below to simulate failure
          # exit 1

  monitor:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: job2
    steps:
      - name: Monitor job2
        uses: your-username/job-status@v1
        with:
          job_name: job2
          wait_time: 30
          poll_interval: 20
          github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}

```


## Detailed Inputs
#### job_name
The name of the job you want to monitor. Ensure that the name matches exactly with the job name in the workflow.

#### wait_time
The time (in seconds) that the action will wait after the monitored job is completed. For example, if you set wait_time to 30, the action will wait 30 seconds after the job completes before finishing.

#### poll_interval
The interval (in seconds) between each status check of the job. The default value is 30 seconds. Adjust this value as needed for more or less frequent checks.

#### github_token
